# Image-Features-Extraction
Computer Vision approaches is of two categories:<br />
1. Appearence-based<br />
2. Model-based or point-based.<br />
This project implements image features using LBP(Local Binary Pattern) which is an appearence based one.
## Technologies
* VisualStudio.
* OpenCV and Boost libraries.
* C++ programming.<br />
Make sure, the input and output directories should be stored in the same project file directory. These two directories' names should be given in command line arguments in visualstudio. <br />
./input ./output
## Implementation
* Program will take TWO arguments:<br />
1. Input image directory <br />
2. Output image directory
